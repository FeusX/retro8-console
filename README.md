<h1>WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?</h1>

<p>This project is an 8 bit (i mean it is actually on 32 bit xtensa processor but as in theme, it is 8 bit) retro console project.</p>

<h1>WHY?</h1>

<p>For fun.</p>

<h1>IS THIS A CONSOLE OR JUST GAMES?</h1>

<p>As i said, this is a console with bootloader, rendering engine, bitmaps, input drivers etc. So it is not just games(and you can build it your own games with existing tools too!).</p>

<h1>HOW CAN I BUILD IT?</h1>

<p>Just install the latest esp-idf and build it with build.sh script, if there is an error you can modify the script yourself.</p>

<h2>THERE IS SOME VIDEOS OF EXISTING GAMES</h2>
